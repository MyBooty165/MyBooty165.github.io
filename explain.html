    <h1>Proxy Explanation</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Almost all proxies use a proxy called Ultraviolet, which is known for being the fastest proxy ever. Some popular apps that utilize Ultraviolet include TerbiumOS, Holy Unblocker, Metallic, Nebula, Interstellar, Abyss (also known as Proxnow), and Incognito. They all use the same HTML connection, JavaScript, and other technologies.</p>
