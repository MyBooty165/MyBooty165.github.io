      <h2>I have sent u this site because i wanna assist you one time only, i will give u code that you can use to officially block proxies, since u hate them so much you accused me of marking <a href="https://dino4.jaydogstack.repl.co">Proxnow</a> so i will help you try to eliminate proxies. This might be useless since ur IT Army might have it alr but here:</h2>

      <button onclick="location.href='/helping-you-cfisd.html'">HTML Code For Proxy Connection</button>
      <br>
      <p>If you live under a rock, then i will explain this, every proxy students here use is from 1 single proxy, <a href="https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-App">Ultraviolet (UV)</a> and ur little IT Army can use that as an advantage</p>

      <button onclick="location.href='/uv-code.html'">Ultraviolet Js Code</button>
      <p>These Files Of Code Are The Same For All Proxies (ex: Now.gg, Terbium, Nebula, Holy Unblocker, Metallic, Incognito, Hypertabs, Abyss aka Proxnow)</p>
